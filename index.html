    "Your ex’s new partner is uglier than you imagined. Enjoy that.",
    "Your future holds fewer awkward phases… but not zero. Nobody’s that lucky.",

    // Bad Fortunes
    "That ‘we need to talk’ text? Yeah, it’s coming. Brace yourself.",
    "Your WiFi will fail at the worst possible moment. Pray for unlimited data.",
    "Someone you trust will betray you. (No, not your dog. Just people.)",
    "Your phone battery will die right when you need to record the drama.",
    "You’ll realize your ‘signature look’ was just a phase. A regrettable one.",

    // Ugly Fortunes
    "One day, you’ll cringe at your old self. Today is that day.",
    "Your future holds a major embarrassment. No spoilers, but it’s already recorded.",
    "That thing you posted at 2 AM? Yeah, it’s still out there. Haunting you.",
    "You’ll laugh at this now, but it’ll hit different at 3 AM.",
    "Your sleep schedule will never recover. Neither will your GPA.",

    // Emotional Fortunes
    "You’ll miss these chaotic days. (Yes, even the cringe ones.)",
    "Someone out there still thinks about that weird thing you said. They’re not mad, just confused.",
    "Your pet loves you more than anyone ever will. Sorry, facts are facts.",
    "You’ll outgrow friends you can’t imagine living without. It’ll hurt, but you’ll be okay.",
    "One day, your parents will seem human. It’ll freak you out.",

    // Random Fortunes
    "Your next crush will have a red flag you choose to ignore. Enjoy the ride.",
    "A group chat you’re in will implode spectacularly. Bring popcorn.",
    "You’ll be put on the spot to tell a fun fact. You still won’t have one.",
    "Your Spotify Wrapped will reveal truths about yourself you’re not ready to face.",
    "A minor inconvenience will ruin your entire week. You’ll call it ‘trauma.’",

    // Messed Up Fortunes
    "You’re aging at a rate of one second per second. Good luck with that.",
    "The ‘perfect’ life you compare yourself to? It’s fake. Go eat a snack.",
    "You’ll have a deep thought in the shower… and forget it immediately.",
    "Your future self is judging you right now. (They’re also cringing.)",
    "None of this will matter in 100 years. But for now, overthink it anyway."
